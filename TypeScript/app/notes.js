// little overwiew on concept of oop
// A class can implement multiple interfaces.
// one classs can only extend a single class 

//one interface extends another interface [multiple extension can be done]
//interface can only have abstract() Interface methods are implicitly abstract — they can’t have implementation (method body). 
// if a class is implementing an interface or extending an abstract class it can have their field and methods and itw own properties and methods as well

// you can not create an object of abstract classes they can only be extended 
// abstract classes abstract method must be defined
