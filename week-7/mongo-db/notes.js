/*
why db before the server started ??

Why before app.listen()?

1. Avoid accepting requests before DB is ready
--> If your server starts listening first but the database connection fails, incoming requests will break because the DB is unavailable.

2. Fail fast on startup
--> If the DB connection fails, youâ€™ll know immediately and can stop the server instead of running a partially broken app.
